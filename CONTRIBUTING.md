# Contributing to openzl-jni

Thanks for taking the time to improve **openzl-jni**. The project aims to provide
usable Java bindings for Metaâ€™s OpenZL compressor, and contributions of all
sizes help move it forward. This guide explains how to propose changes and what
we look for during review.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `dev`.
- Keep each branch focused on a single change set; open separate pull requests
  for unrelated fixes.
- Sync with upstream `dev` before you start to avoid unnecessary merge work.

## Development Workflow

Native and Java code live side by side; validating both parts is encouraged.

```bash
# build the native library
cmake -S . -B cmake_build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build cmake_build --target openzl_jni

# refresh the bundled shared object and run the Maven build
mkdir -p JNI/openzl-jni/src/main/resources/lib/linux_amd64
cp cmake_build/cli/libopenzl_jni.so JNI/openzl-jni/src/main/resources/lib/linux_amd64/
mvn -pl JNI/openzl-jni -am clean package
```

- Prefer incremental rebuilds (`cmake --build cmake_build --target openzl_jni`)
  while iterating; copy the `.so` into the resources directory when you need to
  exercise Java tests.
- Java unit and integration tests run with `mvn -pl JNI/openzl-jni -am test`.
- Add or update tests whenever behaviour changes; large features without test
  coverage are unlikely to be merged.

## Coding Guidelines

- Match the existing code style in each language; avoid sweeping reformatting
  so reviewers can focus on functional changes.
- Keep dependencies minimal and justify new ones in the pull request description.
- Update user-facing documentation (`README.md`, examples, JavaDoc) when APIs or
  build steps change.
- Include concise commit messages that describe the intent of each change.

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Rebase on the latest `dev` and ensure `mvn -pl JNI/openzl-jni -am verify`
  passes before opening the pull request.
- Fill out the pull request template, reference any related issues, and call out
  anything that needs special attention (e.g. platform-specific behaviour).
- Expect to engage in review. Address feedback through follow-up commits or
  comment threads; avoid force-pushing unless you are asked to tidy history.

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests. Include the observed
  behaviour, reproduction steps, environment details (OS, JVM, compiler), and
  expected outcome.
- For confidentiality or security-sensitive disclosures, please avoid filing a
  public issue and reach out privately to the maintainers instead.
